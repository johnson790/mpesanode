     * 1.    Log into OpenAPI with a developer account
     * 2.    On the APPLICATION page, click Create New Application. Creating an application will generate your unique API Application Key needed to authorise and authenticate your application on the server
     * 3.    Type your name and version number for the application and select the products you wish to use. (The application can be configured any time). Save your new application.
     * 4.    Copy and save the API Key.
     * 5.    Copy the Public Key from the below section.
     * 6.    Generate a decoded Base64 string from the Public Key
     * 7.    Generate an instance of an RSA cipher and use the Base 64 string as the input
     * 8.    Encode the API Key with the RSA cipher and digest as Base64 string format
     * 9.    The result is your encrypted API Key.
